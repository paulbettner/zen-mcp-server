# Model Restriction Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `/utils/model_restrictions.py`
- Hardcoded restrictions in the `__init__` method to only allow:
  - **OpenAI**: o3, o3-pro, o3-pro-2025-06-10 (o3-pro is an alias)
  - **Google**: gemini-2.5-pro, pro (pro is an alias) 
  - **OpenRouter**: openai/o3, openai/o3-pro, google/gemini-2.5-pro
- Disabled all other providers (XAI, DIAL, CUSTOM) by setting empty allowed sets
- Fixed `is_allowed` method to properly handle empty sets (return False instead of True)

### 2. Modified `/providers/registry.py`
- Updated hardcoded fallback models from "gemini-2.5-flash" to allowed models
- Fixed `get_preferred_fallback_model` to respect restrictions and use allowed models

### 3. Modified `/tools/listmodels.py`
- Added restriction filtering when listing models for each provider
- Check restrictions before displaying models and aliases
- Handle Custom API restriction checking properly

## Test Results

Running `test_restrictions_comprehensive.py`:
- ✅ All blocked models correctly return error messages
- ✅ Auto mode only selects from allowed models  
- ✅ listmodels tool only shows allowed models
- ✅ 3 out of 4 allowed models work (o3, gemini-2.5-pro, pro)
- ❌ o3-pro fails with "Response blocked or incomplete" (appears to be OpenAI API issue)

**Overall: 12/13 tests pass**

## How It Works

1. When any provider tries to use a model, it checks with `ModelRestrictionService`
2. The service has hardcoded allowed sets for each provider type
3. Empty sets mean the provider is completely disabled
4. Both canonical names and aliases are checked for allowed models
5. The registry respects these restrictions when listing available models

## Note on o3-pro

The o3-pro model appears to have issues at the OpenAI API level. The restriction mechanism is working correctly (it's in the allowed list), but the API call itself fails. This might be due to:
- The model not being available yet
- Different API requirements for o3-pro
- Account-specific access restrictions
